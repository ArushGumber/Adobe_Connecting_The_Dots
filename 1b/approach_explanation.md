# Approach Explanation - Round 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Overview
Our solution implements an intelligent document analyzer that extracts and prioritizes content based on persona expertise and specific job requirements. The system combines natural language processing with domain-specific heuristics to identify the most relevant sections across multiple documents.

## Methodology

### 1. Persona and Job Analysis
- **Keyword Extraction**: Extract domain-specific keywords from persona descriptions using predefined vocabulary for researchers, students, analysts, etc.
- **Job Context Understanding**: Analyze job-to-be-done descriptions to identify key concepts and requirements
- **Dynamic Keyword Generation**: Combine persona keywords with job-specific terms for comprehensive relevance scoring

### 2. Document Structure Extraction
- **PDF Processing**: Use pdfplumber to extract text with formatting metadata including font sizes and positions
- **Heading Detection**: Identify headings using font size analysis, text patterns, and structural cues
- **Content Grouping**: Associate content paragraphs with their parent headings to create logical sections

### 3. Relevance Scoring Algorithm
Our multi-factor scoring system evaluates sections based on:
- **Keyword Density**: Proportion of relevant terms in section text
- **Persona Context**: Domain-specific patterns (e.g., methodology keywords for researchers)
- **Job Alignment**: Specific requirements matching (e.g., "literature review" tasks favor methodology sections)
- **Content Quality**: Length-based penalties for very short or excessively long sections

### 4. Section Prioritization
- **Relevance Ranking**: Sort all sections by computed relevance scores
- **Top-N Selection**: Extract top 5 most relevant sections across all documents
- **Subsection Analysis**: Generate refined text summaries for the top 3 sections

## Technical Implementation
- **NLP Processing**: NLTK for tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design supporting diverse document types and personas
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient PDF processing with minimal memory footprint
- **Robustness**: Error handling for malformed PDFs and edge cases

## Key Features
- **Domain Adaptability**: Supports multiple persona types (academic, business, technical)
- **Context Awareness**: Understands different job requirements and priorities
- **Quality Filtering**: Ensures extracted content meets minimum relevance thresholds
- **Structured Output**: Provides both section-level rankings and detailed subsection analysis
